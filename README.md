# Bluetide
Bluetide is a Twitter 1.1 API to Bluesky converter, built using .NET.
# Why work on this?
I wanted to have a go at working with ASP.NET for an API, as previously I have always used Python and Flask and I wanted to make a change.

This has also never been done before, unlike the Twitter 1.0 API which has [Bluetweety](https://twitterbridge.loganserver.net/) which is what most people use on older mobile operating systems.
